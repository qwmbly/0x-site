    <h1>I Am Offering this Poem</h1>
    <p class="author">By Jimmy Santiago Baca</p>
    
    <p>
        I am offering this poem to you,<br>
        since I have nothing else to give.<br>
        Keep it like a warm coat<br>
        when winter comes to cover you,<br>
        or like a pair of thick socks<br>
        the cold cannot bite through,
    </p>
    
    <p class="refrain">I love you,</p>
    
    <p>
        I have nothing else to give you,<br>
        so it is a pot full of yellow corn<br>
        to warm your belly in winter,<br>
        it is a scarf for your head, to wear<br>
        over your hair, to tie up around your face,
    </p>
    
    <p class="refrain">I love you,</p>
    
    <p>
        Keep it, treasure this as you would<br>
        if you were lost, needing direction,<br>
        in the wilderness life becomes when mature;<br>
        and in the corner of your drawer,<br>
        tucked away like a cabin or hogan<br>
        in dense trees, come knocking,<br>
        and I will answer, give you directions,<br>
        and let you warm yourself by this fire,<br>
        rest by this fire, and make you feel safe
    </p>
    
    <p class="refrain">I love you,</p>
    
    <p>
        It's all I have to give,<br>
        and all anyone needs to live,<br>
        and to go on living inside,<br>
        when the world outside<br>
        no longer cares if you live or die;<br>
        remember,
    </p>
    
    <p class="refrain">I love you.</p>
